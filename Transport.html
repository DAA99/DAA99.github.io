  <p>
    There are only two ways to come and to leave Martha's Vineyard, by air or by sea.
    The Steamship Authority runs out of Woods Hole Massachusetts. It is
    responsible for most of the travel to Martha's Vineyard. Their ferries
    carry cars, trucks and people. The Ferries are very large because they can
    carry a lot of people and vehicles. The ferries arrive in Vineyard Haven or
    Oak Bluffs. The boat ride is about forty minutes long. The second way to come
  or leave the Island
   is by going to the Martha's Vineyard airport.

<p>
The airport is small and is located in the center of the Island. There are many
commercial airlines that fly to the airport and some private planes.
<br><br>
There is also a ferry that brings cars and people from
Edgartown to Chappaquiddick. The Chappy Ferrie runs directly
through Edgartown Harbor. In the summer time the Chappy Ferrie runs
two boats and about three cars can fit on each one. A lot of people travel to
Chappaquiddick to go biking. If you are not taking the Chappy Ferries, you can
still see it. You can see it from a look out in Edgartown. Ferries are not the
only way of transport to get to the Island or to move within the Islands.
<br><br>
The other ways are by biking or taking a taxi or bus. There are several bike rental
shops among the Islands. There are also taxis in the larger towns of Oak Bluffs
and Edgartown. There is also a bus line that runs all around the island These are some of the ways to come and to leave and to travel among Martha's Vineyard.
