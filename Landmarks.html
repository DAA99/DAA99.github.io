  There are several landmarks on the Island of Martha's Vineyard. One of which is the Edgartown
   Lighthouse. It stands at the mouth of Edgartown Harbor. Some Days during the summer people are
   allowed to go up and get great views of Edgartown and Chappeqidick. This is not the first lighthouse
   that has stood there. There are many other Lighthouses on Martha's vineyard but this one is the main
    Lighthouse of the Island. Edgartown Lighthouse is a must see on your trip to Martha's Vineyard.

There is also the Flying Horses Carousel, the oldest operating Carousel in America. It is located in
the heart of OakBluffs. It was once in New York City but moved to Oak Bluffs. The people on the ride go around and collect
 rings from a slot. Whoever gets the brass ring wins a free ride. This is the place to go with kids but it is also fun for adults too.
<br><br>Also in Oak Bluffs is the Gingerbread houses. There are around 318 gingerbread houses. The gingerbread houses are centered around
a church and all of the houses are different from each other. People are allowed to walk around the houses and take pictures with them. This landmark is a great place to walk around at.
