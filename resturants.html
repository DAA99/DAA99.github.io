Martha's Vineyard has lots of restaurants. The Island is known for its seafood.
    One well known restaurant is the Black Dog Tavern. It is owned by the Black Dog company
    which you may know from its clothing stores. The Black Dog Tavern is located next to the ferry port in
     Vineyard Haven. It has great harbor views and you get to see the Ferries come in.</p>

Another great restaurant is Lucky Hanks. It is located on the outskirts of Edgartown. They serve very fresh food.
During the summer season they have a porch and they also have indoor seating. The service at Lucky Hanks is exceptional.
Lucky Hanks is a nice place to eat at.
<br><br>
A great dessert place is Back Door Donuts. It is located in Oak Bluffs. It serves fresh donuts from the back of its shop.
The lines can get very long and is only open during the summer season. There are many more great restaurants.
